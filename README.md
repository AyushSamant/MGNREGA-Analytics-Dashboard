## 🌟 A Data-Driven Insight into India’s Rural Employment Scheme

### 🙏 A Heartfelt Thanks to MGNREGA

The **Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)**, enacted in 2005, has been a cornerstone of India’s social welfare system. By legally guaranteeing 100 days of wage employment annually to rural households, MGNREGA has empowered millions by ensuring livelihood security, promoting rural development, and enhancing social equity.

This dashboard is a humble tribute to the incredible impact MGNREGA has made across India. Thank you to every field officer, data collector, and policy maker involved in this nation-building initiative.
